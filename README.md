# Animated Logo

This Fabric mod replaces the default **Mojang Studios boot screen** with the **Minecraft Dungeons animated logo** when the game starts.

Instead of the standard Mojang intro, the game plays the Dungeons-style logo animation during startup, giving Minecraft a unique and cinematic launch experience.
